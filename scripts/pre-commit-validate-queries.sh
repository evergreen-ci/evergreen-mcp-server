# Pre-commit hook to validate GraphQL queries
#
# This script can be installed as a git pre-commit hook to validate
# GraphQL queries before each commit. It helps catch query validation
# errors early in the development process.
#
# To install as a pre-commit hook:
#     cp scripts/pre-commit-validate-queries.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
#     chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# Or use with pre-commit framework by adding to .pre-commit-config.yaml:
#     - repo: local
#       hooks:
#         - id: validate-graphql-queries
#           name: Validate GraphQL Queries
#           entry: ./scripts/pre-commit-validate-queries.sh
#           language: system
#           files: 'src/evergreen_mcp/evergreen_queries\.py$|merged-schema\.graphql$'
